Welcome to BNAS's documentation!
================================
BNAS (Basic Neural Architecture Subprograms) is
a set of helper classes and functions for Theano to facilitate experiments
with machine learning, in particular for natural language processing. Unlike
libraries such as Keras and Blocks, the purpose is rather to help people
(myself in particular) use Theano efficiently when developing new
architectures.
